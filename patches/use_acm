init: Remove USE_IB_ACM configuration option

When the librdmacm is configured, it sets the USE_IB_ACM option
if infininband/acm.h is found.  We can remove this option with
very little overhead, which would allow a user to install
ACM after installing the librdmacm, and the librdmacm would be
able to make use of ACM.
