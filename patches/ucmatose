ucmatose: Fix number of connections to disconnect

When ucmatose aborts because of issues trying to connect
to the server, it moves to disconnecting all connections.
However, not all connections may have been established.
The result is that ucmatose will hang in disconnect_events.
Fix this by setting the number of times that we need to
disconnect to the number of times that we successfully
connect.

This problem is based on a report by Doug Ledford
