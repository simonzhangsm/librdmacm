Call ucma_ib_init() during startup

ucma_ib_init() was removed from ucma_init() to avoid
recursive callback issues when using the librspreload
library over rsockets.  Although rsockets calls ucma_ib_init,
other pieces of the code do not.  The result is that
ibacm ends up being disabled unless rsockets has been
used.  Fix this by calling ucma_ib_init() where needed.
