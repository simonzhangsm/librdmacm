rstream: Set rsocket nonblocking if set to async operation

If asynchronous use is specified (use of poll/select), set the
rsocket to nonblocking.  This matches the common usage case for
asynchronous sockets.

When asynchronous support is enabled, the nonblocking/blocking
test option determines whether the poll/select call will block,
or if rstream will spin on the calls.

This provides more flexibility with how the rsocket is used.
Specifically, MPI often uses nonblocking sockets, but spins on
poll/select.  However, many apps will use nonblocking sockets,
but wait on poll/select.
